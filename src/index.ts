/**
 * GamesmanStatus â€“ bootstrap file (placeholder)
 *
 * Stack: Node + TypeScript + Fastify + SQLite
 *
 * This file will eventually:
 *  - read env + config
 *  - start Fastify HTTP server
 *  - register routes: /healthz, /v1/summary, /v1/history
 *  - start the scheduler loop in the background
 *
 * For now, this is intentionally empty to keep v1 scaffolding code-free.
